# DSC 510 - Introduction to Programming

The enclosed documents of this folder are the weekly assignments and projects for beginning to learn Python programming. Below are the descriptions to each file.

## 2.1 - User Input

This file demonstrates the understanding of the file's relation to the user when asking for user input. It is displayed through different types of input.

## 4.1 - Functions with User Input

This file takes the user's input to calculate various formulas. This particular file acts as a register's calculator or register for the "store", made up for this assignment.

## 5.1 - Loops with User Input

This file runs a loop based on the user's response. The user can tell it to run calculations of a certain kind or complete when the user is done.

## 6.1 - User Input - Temperatures

This file asks the user for temperatures and generates a response with the numbers.

## 7.1 - Dictionaries

This file reads and parses the Gettysburg address in order to sort and count it into dictionaries.

## 8.1 - Processing Files

This file builds on the previous 7.1 assignment and inputs the dictionary created from the Gettysburg address to an independent file.

## 9.1 - Web Services

This file accesses a URL to generate a random response, based on if the user wants a response or not.

## 10.1 - Cash Register Calculator

This file creates a cash register that acts as a calculator. The user inputs the prices of their items and once complete, the cash register will give them the total.

## 10.2 - API Program

This file accesses a weather API. The user will input a US city or zip code, and the code will return a list of weather metrics for that location.
